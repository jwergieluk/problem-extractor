\problem{Independent increments and filtrations.} 
Let $X = (X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ be a stochastic process with independent increments,
i.e.\ for all $0=t_{0}\leq t_1 \dots \leq t_n$ the random elements $X_0,
X_{t_1}-X_{t_1},\dots ,X_{t_n}-X_{t_{n-1}}$ are independent.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $X_t -X_s \upmodels \cF_{s}^{X}$ for all $0\leq s\leq t$. 
\end{enumerate}

\solution Note that the $\sigma$-algebra induced by $f(X_0)$ for a
measurable function $f$ is smaller than $\sigma(X_0)$. Therefore $\sigma(X_s)
\subset \sigma(X_0, X_s-X_0)$ and by assumption $\sigma(X_s) \upmodels
\sigma(X_t-X_s)$. By the grouping theorem \cite[p. 51]{Kallenberg}, we get
$X_{t}-X_{s}\upmodels \cF_s^{X}$. 


\problem{Borel sets in Euclidean space are regular.} $Q$ is a probability
measure on $(\bR, \cB(\bB))$ and $\varepsilon>0$ a fixed real number. Then
every set in $(\bR, \cB(\bR))$ is regular. This means there is a closed set $F$
and an open set $G$ with $F\subset A \subset G$ such that $Q(G\setminus
F)<\varepsilon$ for arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$. 


\problem{Filtations and continuity of paths.} Let $X$ be a stochastic process
on a probability space $(\Omega, \cA, P)$ and $\cF^{X}=(\cF^{X}_{t})_{t\geq 0}$
be the natural filtration of $X$. Moreover, $A$ is the event that $X$ is
continuous on $[0, t_0)$. Then following holds:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $X$ has c\`adl\`ag paths, i.e. every path of $X$ is a c\`adl\`ag
        function, then $A\in \cF^{X}_{t_0}$. 

    \item If $X$ is c\`adl\`ag, i.e. $X$ has c\`adl\`ag paths a.s., then $A$
        may fail to be in $\cF^{X}_{t_0}$.

    \item If $X$ is c\`adl\`ag, and $(\cF_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ is a filtration
        containing $\cF^{X}$ such that $\cF_{0}$ contains all $P$-null events
        in $\cA$, then $A\in \cF_{t_0}$.

    \item If $X$ has c\`agl\`ad paths and is adapted to a right-continuous
        filtration $(\cF_{t})_{t\geq 0}$, then $A\in \cF_{t_{0}}$. 
\end{enumerate}
